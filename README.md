## What is QueerJS?

QueerJS is a meetup that started in Berlin with future events planned for Amsterdam, Barcelona, London, San Francisco and beyond. The idea of the meetup is that anyone can start a version in their city.

This meetup was created to give queer people a safe space to lend their voice to the tech community. And hopefully give some visibility to amazing, talented, queer speakers so we never get asked to speak about being queer in tech again.

## What should I talk about?

Anything you're passionate about, really. The talks don't have to be technical (but they certainly can be). The most important thing is that you're excited about your topic. That's the amazing thing about public speaking - you get to share your passions with the world.

## Can I do a short talk?

Sure! That would be amazing!

## How long should a talk be?

At every event, we plan to have a mix of longer 20-25 minute talks and 5-10 minute lightning talks. So do whatever you feel most comfortable with! If you need longer to present, please let us know so we can adjust the schedule or coordinate with the venue.

## Can you pay for my flights?

Actually, there's a good chance that we can. If you'd like to speak at an upcoming meetup and need travel assistance for any reason, ping the QueerJS team and we'll let you know if it's possible :relaxed:

## Who is behind this?

A bunch of humans! You can meet them all here: https://queerjs.com/organizers

If you'd like to help organize or bring QueerJS to your city, ping [Sara Vieira](https://github.com/SaraVieira).

## Can I print the meetup stickers and give them away in other places?

Please do, they're all open source and you can find them here:  https://github.com/queerjs/brand-assets

## Any other questions?

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/queerjs/info/issues) or send an email to hello@queerjs.com


Keep being awesome! \
