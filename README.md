## What is it?

QueerJS is a meetup started in berlin that expects to go in many more places. The idea of the meetup is that anyone can start their version in their city.

This meetup was created to give queer people a safe space. To give them a voice and try to bring some balance to the tech community in these matters and hopefully get some queer speakers in the community so we never get asked to speak about being queer in tech again.

## What should I talk about?

Really anything you are passioned about. Talks don't have to be technical and really talk about what your passions. That's the amazing thing about public speaking, you share your passions with the world.

## Can I do a short talk?

Sure! That would be amazing!

## What are the talk lengths?

We plan on having talks that last about 20-25 minutes and also lightning talks that should be 5-10 minutes so just do what you are most comfortable with. If you need to go longer just let us know in case we need to warn the venue or something like that.

## Can you pay for my flights?
Actually, there is a high probability that I can so if you would like to speak somewhere else where the meetup is happening for any reason ping me and I will let you know if it is possible :)

## Who is behind this?

A bunch of humans, you can meet them all here: https://queerjs.com/organizers

Ping me also if you would like to help organize.

## Can I print the meetup stickers and give them away in other places?

Please do, they are all open source and you can find them here:  https://github.com/queerjs/brand-assets

## Any other questions?

Please open up an issue or ping me at the email at the top!

Keep being awesome
